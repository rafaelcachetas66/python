# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Look at the code in the code editor. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code
# so that it runs without errors.

# Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character 
# for character, even space and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

# EXAMPLE:
# When you run your program, it should print the following:
# Day 1 - String Manipulation
# String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
# New line can be created with a backslash and n.

# Fix the code:

# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello" + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.'))

# Write the code below:

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New line can be created with a backslash and n.")
