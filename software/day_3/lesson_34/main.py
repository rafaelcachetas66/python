# CODING EXERCISE: Leap Year

# INSTRUCTIONS
# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A
# normal year has 365 days, leap years have 356.
# This how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
    # on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
    # except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
    # unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
    
# 2000 / 4 = 500 (leap)
# 2000 / 100 = 20 (not leap)
# 2000 / 400 = 5 (leap)

# 2000 is a leap year

# Which year do you want to check?
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))

# Write your code below

# If/Else Statements
if(year % 4 == 0):
    if(year % 100 != 0):
        print("It is a leap year.")
    else:
        if(year % 400 != 0):
            print("It is not a leap year.")
        else:
            print("It is a leap year.")
else:
    print("It is not a leap year.")
